      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m constantly exploring. I enjoy learning new skills — whether it’s picking up a new instrument, diving into design software, or experimenting with recipes in the kitchen. I also have a love for nature, travel, and late-night documentaries that challenge the way I see the world.
